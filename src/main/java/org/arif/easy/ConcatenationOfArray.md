## Easy ArrayConcatenation Solution with Detailed Intuition and Approach, Easy to Understand

## Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` of length `n`, the task is to create a new array `ans` of length `2n` where for each index `0 <= i < n`, `ans[i]` equals `nums[i]` and `ans[i + n]` also equals `nums[i]`. Essentially, the array `ans` should be the concatenation of two `nums` arrays.

## Intuition
The intuitive approach to solving this problem involves duplicating the given array `nums` and appending it to itself. This can be achieved by iterating through the `nums` array and copying its elements to the new array `ans` twice â€“ first in the initial positions and then in the positions offset by the length of `nums`.

## Approach
- Initialize a new array `ans` of size `2n`, where `n` is the length of `nums`.
- Loop through each element in `nums`.
- For each index `i` (ranging from `0` to `n - 1`), set `ans[i] = nums[i]` and `ans[n + i] = nums[i]`.
- This will effectively place each element of `nums` in `ans` twice, once in its original position and once offset by `n`.
- Return the array `ans`.

## Complexity
- **Time complexity:** $$O(n)$$ - The solution requires a single pass through the `nums` array.
- **Space complexity:** $$O(n)$$ - Additional space is needed for the array `ans`, which is twice the size of `nums`.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] getConcatenation(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        if (n == 0) return new int[]{};
        int[] ans = new int[n * 2];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            ans[i] = nums[i];
            ans[n + i] = nums[i];
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
